<p>Google CEO Eric Schmidt and political science Professor Condoleezza Rice discuss threats to cybersecurity during Stanford's boot camp for congressional staffers. </p>
</div>

			

			

</div>
			
<p>In the early years of communicating by computer, nobody worried about electronic interlopers sniffing through private files, Google&#160; executive chairman Eric Schmidt told a gathering of key congressional staffers on the Stanford campus.</p>
<p>But that has changed in a big way &#8211; witness Chinese hackers and the National Security Agency. In the end, Schmidt said, technology, rather than law, is more likely to reinstate privacy: "Everything is going to have to be encrypted all the way."</p>
<p>The software engineer, who joined Google in 2001, spoke in a conversation with Condoleezza Rice, the former U.S. secretary of state who is now a Stanford professor of political science and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.</p>
<p>"I come here because this is where all the innovation in the country seems to start," Schmidt said. He noted that Stanford researchers have, in fact, played a <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2011/march/inventor-prize-hellman-030411.html">historical role</a> in the development of encryption.</p>
<p>Looking for good news? Schmidt predicted unbreakable end-to-end encryption "within our lifetime." &#160;Google now offers encrypted email, and Yahoo is following.</p>
<p>The three-day workshop was cosponsored by Stanford's&#160;<a href="http://cisac.stanford.edu/">Center for International Security and Cooperation</a>&#160;and the&#160;<a href="http://www.hoover.org/">Hoover Institution</a>. The boot camp was led by <a href="http://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/amy_zegart">Amy Zegart</a>, the co-director of CISAC and a senior fellow at Hoover, and <a href="http://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/herbert_lin/">Herb Lin</a>, a CISAC consulting scholar and chief scientist at the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, National Research Council of the National Academies.</p>
<p>Schmidt, in response to a question from Rice about classes students should take, noted that 75 percent of Stanford students take at least one computer science course.&#160; He talked about the importance of data science &#8211; a topic Google scientists know well. &#160;He pointed out that President Obama's campaign organization made good use of data science.</p>
<p>Voice recognition, text recognition and face recognition by cameras and computers have become very good, but pose a privacy threat, Schmidt said. Placing cameras everywhere would drastically reduce crime, he said, but at the cost of privacy.</p>
<div>
<p>On a different topic, Schmidt said Google has been working hard to create a virtual personal assistant that would know its user very well, could take care of business and even offer advice.&#160; "I want a program that answers all my email," Schmidt said.</p>
</div>
<p>Schmidt's conversation with Rice was part of Stanford's inaugural cybersecurity boot camp for key congressional staffers who deal with cybersecurity issues.</p>
<p>The participants, from both sides of the political aisle, earlier heard from, among others, <a href="http://cisac.stanford.edu/people/jane_holl%20lute/">Jane Holl Lute</a>, a former deputy secretary of homeland security, the current president of the Council on CyberSecurity and a consulting professor at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation. "Nothing you do online is secure," she warned. Schmidt touched on a similar topic. Government computers are typically out of date and vulnerable to attack, he said. Even something as simple as a software update would be an improvement, he said.</p>
<p>Stanford President John Hennessy and Larry Kramer, former dean of Stanford Law School and now president of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, held a keynote conversation for the congressional staffers during lunch on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hennessy asked Kramer about the foundation's new <a href="http://www.hewlett.org/newsroom/press-release/hewlett-foundation-launches-20-million-cyber-initiative">$20 million initiative</a> on cyberthreats against the government, businesses and individuals and why he believes cybersecurity is such an important issue.</p>
<p>"The gap we found is that there is very little work being done in terms of long-term public policy analysis, " Kramer said. "Government and industry &#8211; we're plunging ahead dealing with the problems that are right in front of us &#8211; but nobody is really thinking about a long-term government framework to make this work."</p>
