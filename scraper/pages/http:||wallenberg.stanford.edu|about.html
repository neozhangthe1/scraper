<p>The building that today is Wallenberg Hall (Building 160) was completed in 1900. Funded by the generous gift of Thomas Welton Stanford, Leland Stanford's younger brother, the building has served as the library, the administrative center, the law school and home of the department of political science during its 100-year lifespan.</p>
  <p>In 1999, Building 160 was chosen to showcase the University's commitment to advances in the education process. The interior was completely redeveloped as part of a generous $15 million grant from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg and Marcus and Marianne Wallenberg Foundations in Sweden. The Wallenberg Hall gift is the largest such grant from this foundation, and the first made outside of Sweden.</p>
  <p>The union of past and future weds the original 19th Century sandstone exterior of Wallenberg Hall to a 21st Century interior infrastructure designed to support the technologies of today and tomorrow. From the double-height Peter Wallenberg Learning Theater and technology-enhanced classrooms on the first floor, to the research center on the fourth floor, Wallenberg Hall is a working laboratory where the learning tools and methods of the future are being explored.</p>
